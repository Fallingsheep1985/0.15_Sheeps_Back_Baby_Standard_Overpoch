FoamysWorld Epoch Scripts
==========
FMission is the current script set under development. 

(NOTE: All scripts tested and scripted for 1.0.3.1 and No, I will not be upgrading to the latest Epoch Version)

See "FMission Instructions" for FMission install information.

Thank you to all those who contribute to the Epoch Community.
I credit you all in this work as I have read so many scripts and learned so much from them 
that I can not tell you where or who I got ideas from any more. So, I credit you all.

CODE DISCLAIMER:

Do Not Change the base FMission Files. You may use the scripts to make any mission 
type you want but I ask that the base files be left alone so the functionality can 
be maintained.

You may create new files FROM the original files to add on to your own personal Mission 
system but do NOT alter the originals within FMission.

Other than that, you may use the scripts as you see fit. Enjoy.
